``ml_adp`` is a Python package embedding into the Pytorch neural network and optimization framework and serves the numerical solution of Markovian discrete-time finite-horizon stochastic optimal control problems.
It exports a list-like interface to the central functional components of such optimal control problems, allowing for concise implementations of numerical methods that rely on the approximate satisfaction of the discrete-time Bellman equations (Approximate Dynamic Programming; ADP).
