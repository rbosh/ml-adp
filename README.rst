``ml_adp`` embeds into the Pytorch neural network and optimization framework and serves the numerical solution of Markovian finite-horizon discrete-time stochastic optimal control problems.
It interfaces such optimal control problems in a list-like manner, allowing for concise implementations of numerical methods that rely on the approximate satisfaction of the discrete-time Bellman equations (Approximate Dynamic Programming; ADP).

Documentation is available `here`__.
